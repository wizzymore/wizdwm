(empty workspaces have their color greyed out)

- NOTE: This is vanilla dwm bar (status2d patch for setting colors) not dwmblocks or polybar.

# Tag preview (while hovering tag icon)

# Requirements

- xsetroot package ( status2d uses this to add colors on dwmbar)
- xmenu (for layoutmenu)
- JetbrainsMono Nerd Font (or any nerd font) and Material design icon font

# Setup 

- Put the .dwm folder in ~/
- chmod +x all scripts in .dwm folder
- Put layoutmenu.sh in your PATH 
- copy the stuff from fonts folder to your ~/.local/share/fonts ( this is for material design icon font )
- change sid ( my username ) to yours in config.deh.h
- cd into chadwm and sudo make install
- autostart file must be adjusted for your liking!
- start dwm with exec ~/.dwm/autostart (NOT EXEC DWM) cuz autostart already runs dwm at the last , or make a dwm.desktop ( in /usr/share/xsessions folder ) replace the exec value from dwm to /home/your_username/.dwm/autostart.
